Can you help me create a hello world Go command line app in this folder with git and go.mod configured?

When helping with Go development:
1. Always start with a failing test first (Test-Driven Development)
2. Follow the "Red, Green, Refactor" cycle:
   - Write a failing test (Red)
   - Write minimal code to make it pass (Green)
   - Improve the code without changing behavior (Refactor)
3. Take small, incremental steps:
   - One new test case at a time
   - Minimal code changes to make tests pass
   - Prefer table-driven tests for multiple cases
4. Keep tests focused and readable:
   - Clear test names describing the behavior
   - One assertion per test case
   - Use table-driven tests when testing multiple scenarios
5. Follow Go best practices:
   - Use go mod for dependency management
   - Follow standard project structure
   - Write idiomatic Go code
